# Python exercises for linguists

This is a small collection of programming exercises originally designed for a beginner-level Python course that takes place in the context of a Master's in Language Technology.

The challenge in this specific course is that, while most participants have a background in linguistics and little to no previous exposure to programming, some have extensive coding experience but are still expected to take the course.
Because of this, many exercises consist of a "core" that everyone is expected to solve, some "hints" directed at absolute beginners and some extra challenges for more expert programmers.

In the list below, each exercise is accompanied by a list of prerequisites. 
Non-bold items are only required to solve the more advanced version of the exercises.
